js-boilerplate
==============

This repo serves as a boilerplate for my JavaScript projects. Feel free to use, improve and discuss!

It comes setup with:

- [Babel] for ES6, ES2015-polifyll, yield/await, etc.
- [Flow] for type checking
- [Eslint] for linting (extends [standard]'s config)
- [Mocha] for testing
- [Unexpected] for assertions
- [Istanbul] for code coverage
- [dot-only-hunter] to avoid merging `.only`'s

And it reports to:

- [TravisCI] for build status
- [Coveralls] for code coverage status

Special thanks to [@jvlucic] for encouraging people to start their own boilerplate (despite the fact that thousands already exist).
